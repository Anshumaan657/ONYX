# Phase 3 review checkpoint

## Implemented scope

Financial Setup Wizard, product/material prices, machine/labour rates, overheads, quality/rework/scrap costs, factory calendar, conversions, aliases, effective dates, Excel/JSON import/export and explicit local persistence consent. The primary page is now a guided working surface rather than a marketing landing page.

The importer remains in its worker while users move between screens. Financial setup can reuse eligible MMS product/machine identifiers. The existing MMS file-read cancellation race was corrected so a cancelled read cannot start a new worker later.

## Verification performed (30 August 2026)

- ESLint and TypeScript checks: pass.
- Production Next.js build: pass.
- Default automated suite: 70 pass; 1 optional real-workbook test skipped without its external path.
- Full suite with the external MMS sample: 71 pass.
- Sample regression: 13,617 production records and 30,848 downtime records. The known invalid duration at Down Time Details row 14 remains excluded, not silently corrected.
- Finance tests cover blank/zero/invalid input, date gaps/overlaps, approvals, consolidated/itemized costs, units, aliases, calendar exceptions, safe Excel text, cached formulas, file contracts, JSON/Excel round-trips, consent, expiry and storage failure.
- UI tests cover navigation/state retention, date input, draft/confirmed transitions, review, consent and MMS cancellation during file reading.
- In-app browser smoke checks: navigation, product editing, explicit zero, native dates retained across sections, JSON worker import preview, keeping the existing draft, review navigation, and Excel/JSON export completion. No browser error logs were reported in those checks.
- Narrow/tablet and desktop layouts checked for horizontal document overflow; none observed. This is not a complete cross-browser accessibility certification.
- Production-only and full dependency audits: npm reported zero known vulnerabilities at verification time.
- Source scan: no application upload/fetch calls, financial logging or default persistence. Generated financial JSON filenames are ignored by Git.

## Review limitations and later-phase work

- Phase 3 does not calculate profit, forecasts or final reports. The setup review validates inputs, not financial correctness.
- Confirmation is local/self-declared. Immutable approved master/policy history is Phase 4; authenticated maker-checker approval is later multi-user work.
- Local saving is consented and unencrypted. Passphrase encryption is not provided. Use session-only mode or protected backups for sensitive environments.
- Refreshing loses the in-memory MMS worker; reimport the source workbook. Only financial draft settings can be restored locally.
- Separate Chrome/Edge/Safari/WebKit certification and 50 MB / 1 GB memory benchmarking remain release acceptance work. Do not treat this checkpoint as a production security approval.
- Selected-case financial verification and named 3D business/technical approvers remain required before final acceptance.

## Owner review checklist

1. Import the real MMS workbook and continue to Financial Setup.
2. Confirm names/dates can be added without made-up rates.
3. Add a product, machine, labour rate, overhead, quality cost, calendar rule, conversion and alias.
4. Try a blank material cost, explicit zero and negative input; confirm the differences.
5. Create overlapping price periods and confirm the review flags them.
6. Export Excel/JSON, import the export, inspect the replacement preview, then confirm it only if desired.
7. On a trusted browser, consent to local saving, refresh, restore, then delete the saved draft.
8. Approve this phase before committing or starting Phase 4.

## Commit and merge through a pull request

Run only after review. No direct push to main is needed.

```bash
cd "/Users/anshumaansharma0404gmail.com/3D-Local/Onyx"
git switch feat/financial-master
git status --short --branch
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
git add README.md .gitignore docs src
git diff --cached --stat
git commit -m "feat: add financial setup wizard and master data portability"
git push -u origin feat/financial-master
```

With the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head feat/financial-master --title "Phase 3: Financial Setup Wizard" --body "Adds the financial master wizard, effective-date validation, Excel/JSON portability and consent-based local drafts. Review checklist and verification are in docs/PHASE_3_REVIEW.md."
gh pr checks feat/financial-master --watch
```

After reviewing the PR and confirming required checks pass:

```bash
gh pr merge feat/financial-master --merge
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short --branch
```

Without GitHub CLI, open the repository on GitHub, create a pull request with base `main` and compare `feat/financial-master`, wait for checks, and use **Create a merge commit**. Then run the final three local synchronization commands above. No force push, hard reset or automatic merge is required.
