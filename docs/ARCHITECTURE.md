# Architecture

## Direction

Onyx uses Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Historical workbook processing, filtering and exports are intended to remain client-side by default.

The user interface must depend on typed calculation results. Calculation engines must never depend on React components.

```text
Workbook parser
  -> canonical production and downtime records
  -> versioned financial master and policy
  -> revenue, cost, loss and profit engines
  -> forecast and recommendation engines
  -> one filtered analytics result
  -> dashboard and reports
```

## Phase 2 importer

The browser transfers the selected workbook buffer to a dedicated Web Worker. The worker validates the file envelope and MMS contract, parses saved workbook values, creates canonical production and downtime records, and returns a compact review summary to the interface.

The canonical model preserves the source sheet and one-based source row on every record. Exact duplicates and negative values remain available as evidence but are excluded from ordinary totals. Reported `Qty` is authoritative; `Stroke × M. Factor` is a validation comparison only.

The worker retains the complete canonical import in memory for future calculation phases. Cancelling or replacing an import terminates that worker and releases its local state.

## Planned source boundaries

### Phase 3 implementation

- `src/features/workflow/analysis-workspace.tsx` keeps Import and Financial Setup mounted, showing only the active step. Switching steps preserves the in-memory draft and live MMS worker.
- `src/core/financial/schema.ts` defines schema version 1 and the eight section contracts. The same field definitions drive forms, validation and Excel headers.
- `src/core/financial/validation.ts` checks business inputs independently of React. Missing inputs, invalid/conflicting inputs and warnings remain distinct.
- `src/core/financial/portability.ts` validates JSON shape and Excel structure, uses saved formula values only, and escapes formula-like exported text. Financial imports are capped at 10 MB / 10,000 rows.
- `src/workers/financial-master.worker.ts` parses imported financial masters off the UI thread. The UI previews a replacement before applying it.
- `src/core/financial/draft-storage.ts` owns the single namespaced local-storage entry. Consent is required for writes; expiry is anchored to consent time, not extended silently on every save.
- The wizard keeps raw form input strings so empty, zero and invalid drafts can round-trip. Numeric Excel values are typed when valid; JSON preserves exact draft text. Later financial engines must validate and resolve inputs before using them.
- The master carries a draft ID/revision. Immutable approved master/policy snapshots and downstream calculation fingerprints belong to the next phases.

No React component calculates revenue or profit. The setup review is not an approval of financial accuracy.

## Historical financial engine

The MMS Web Worker retains the canonical import and accepts a bounded historical-analysis request containing only the selected dates and current financial master. `src/core/historical/engine.ts` is a pure calculation boundary; React renders its serializable report and never performs financial arithmetic.

The engine resolves effective-dated master rows and confirmed aliases, applies direct unit conversions, aggregates with exact rational arithmetic, and returns complete, partial or unavailable metrics. MMS material, machine and operator rates may be used only as disclosed estimated fallbacks. Selling prices and overheads are not invented from production data.

Results preserve source row references and calculation explanations. Detailed evidence and SVG daily trends use progressive disclosure in the UI. This phase does not create loss causality, recommendations or forecasts.

### Phase 4.1 implementation

- `src/core/policy/schema.ts` defines a strict serializable policy contract, separate from financial-master drafts. Expressions are descriptive text, never evaluated code.
- `src/core/policy/registry.ts` constructs a detached, deeply read-only catalog with exact policy-ID/version lookup. Unknown versions remain unavailable; duplicate references are rejected.
- The catalog currently has no persistence or UI wiring. Cross-version validity, executable formula binding, financial-master snapshots and confidence evaluation follow the review gates in `docs/PHASE_4_PLAN.md`.
- Self-declared approval evidence is structurally validated, not authenticated. No default financial policy is promoted to confirmed.

### Phase 4.2 implementation

- `src/core/policy/formulas.ts` holds 22 versioned definitions and fixed-code scalar implementations; callers cannot execute arbitrary formula text.
- `src/core/policy/exact.ts` carries exact fractions between steps and formats only at the final display boundary. Public values use numerator/denominator strings so JSON serialization does not lose precision.
- `src/core/policy/evaluate.ts` binds policy metadata to known implementations and validates explicit dates, scope, unit/source/category evidence and mandatory inputs. Results include explanations, input references, warnings and unavailable reasons.
- Formula policies require caller-provided governance and start provisional. No active dates, confidence scores, financial inputs or approvers are supplied by default.
- This is a standalone core API, not dashboard integration or a full ledger. Future engines must resolve aliases/conversions, select source quantities and master versions, prove cost coverage, allocate shared costs and prevent cross-record double counting. See `docs/FORMULA_REFERENCE.md`.

### Phase 4.3–4.5 implementation

- `src/core/policy/releases.ts` owns immutable master/policy releases, canonical SHA-256 integrity, parent lineage, publication/approval transitions, date selection/coverage and replayable pinned runs. Governance release revisions are separate from executable formula versions.
- `src/core/policy/confidence.ts` applies versioned rules and evidence-backed quality components to individual results. Missing required inputs/assessments never receive a high-confidence label by default.
- `src/core/policy/portability.ts` verifies complete archives and merges only compatible history prefixes. `local-archive.ts` owns a separate consent/expiry-controlled storage key and rejects stale or conflicting saves.
- `src/workers/policy-archive.worker.ts` parses and verifies bounded JSON imports off the UI thread. The UI previews before applying them.
- `src/features/policies` provides a secondary policy/release workspace and backup/privacy controls. Financial Setup remains mounted; restoring an archived master is a separately confirmed action. Concurrent operations cannot silently drop newer history.
- No durable server, authenticated approval or tamper-proof audit service is claimed. Future engines must bind actual normalized source/master inputs before financial publication; the current UI does not calculate or display factory-wide profit.

- `src/app`: routes, layouts and route-specific presentation
- `src/components`: reusable UI components
- `src/features`: user workflows such as import and financial setup
- `src/core`: framework-independent domain types and calculation engines
- `src/workers`: cancellable workbook parsing and future heavy calculation workers
- `src/lib`: cross-cutting utilities and adapters

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Preserve source sheet and row evidence through normalization.
- Never mutate the uploaded workbook.
- Reject major structural incompatibilities instead of guessing.
- Keep actual, estimated and opportunity categories separate.
- Resolve double-counting through a causal loss ledger.
- Recalculate all downstream views from the same filtered analytics result.
- Cache only against explicit source, policy and configuration fingerprints.

## Deployment direction

The application must support local laptop use, protected Vercel staging and a future offline-capable company deployment. Advanced Python forecasting and server persistence are postponed beyond the MVP.
